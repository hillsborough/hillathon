# Citizenvestor 

For the first time ever, Hillsborough County is opening up data from numerous departments to Tampa Bay's technology community and is offering prizes for the best apps built on top of the data. The money raised for this project will go towards funding the prizes for the App-a-thon competition.  

The first ever App-a-thon will take place April 12-14, 2013 at the Hillsborough Community College campus in Brandon. Be sure to check back here as more details for the App-a-thon are announced.

The County is excited to be using Citizinvestor - a Hillsborough County based company - to crowdfund the prizes for this exciting event! As with all projects on Citizinvestor, your credit card will not be charged until this project reaches 100% of its funding goal. So make your pledge today and encourage your friends on Facebook and Twitter to do the same!
